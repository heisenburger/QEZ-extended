Forked from [QEZ by kb_elmo](https://github.com/kb-elmo/QEZ). This is my first attempt at building a keyboard from the PCB up. I'm not experienced in hardware / firmware projects at all, so I am learning slowly but lots as I go :)

### Todo

- [ ] Layout design
- [ ] Keymap design
- [ ] PCB mockup
- [ ] Case design
